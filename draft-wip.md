**Hypoxia, mitochondria and ROS**

Hypoxia occurs when the body or a specific tissue is being deprived of oxygen, causing cellular stress to organelles such as mitochondria (Rahane, et al., 2024). Under hypoxic conditions, mitochondria produce less reactive oxygen species (ROS) (and ATP) to adapt to lower oxygen levels and avoid the uncontrolled production of ROS (Fuhrmann & Brüne, 2017). But link to spaceflight?

**Link between hypoxia and ROS?**

Need help! Don't quite understand HIF

**ROS in microgravity** (human and mice)

An increase in production of ROS has been linked to the progression of inflammation, cell death and cancerous tumours (Mittal, et al., 2014). In microgravity simulations, increased ROS production and consequently ROS tissue levels have been observed in mice (Takahashi, et al., 2017). Exposure to deep space radiation and the production of ROS can both cause damage in proteins, RNA and DNA (Meerman, et al., 2021). The higher linear energy transfer (LET) radiation astronauts are exposed to in space as compared to Earth can cause more biological damage in the form of clustered DNA damage, which can lead to genetic mutations, carcinogenesis and chromosome exchanges (Meerman, et al., 2021). While astronauts typically engage in regular exercise regiments in space to prevent bone loss, higher ROS production in the human body can also result in increased acute bone loss via different molecular mechanisms unrelated to exercise (Kennedy, 2014).

The Apollo program showed a possible link between irradiation experienced in space travel and cardiovascular disease: Apollo astronauts had a higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease due to deep space radiation experienced while travelling, however this only considers a small sample size of astronauts (Delp, et al., 2016).
