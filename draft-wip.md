# Draft (WIP)

Nature article

Pros of using minimally invasive (blood, fluid samples)

\-&#x20;

\- Studied the effects of microgravity independently by drawing comparisons between the cfRNA data of human plasma to mouse plasma from another JAXA spaceflight mission that utilised an artificial gravity device on the Japanese ISS Kibo Experiment Module.&#x20;

\


Problems with mitochondrial thing

\- exMT release and inter-organ trafficking have been reported in the context of metabolic stress responses and internal tissue damage associated with isxhemia in the heart, adipose tissue, kidney, lung and brain (find your own source, problems)

\- cytosolic release of mitochondrial components has been reported in the context of various mitochondrial dysfunctions which could subsequently released as EVs in cell death.

\


Mitochondrial isolation methods

\- roughly c: During spaceflight, an increased presence of cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA in the plasma indicates the presence of extracellular mitochondria (exMT) or the release of cytosolic mitochondrial components into the bloodstream.

\- Hypothesis: Mitochondrial cfDNA and cfRNA (derived from mitochondria) may be protected inside extracellular vesicles (EVs), hence the researchers chose to isolate EVs based on cell surface antigens for further characterisation. (Because unprotected nucleic acids in plasma are highly unstable)

Determining tissue origin

\- RNA isolated from purified fraction and ran RNA seq analysis, showed that RNA in CD36 fraction isolated from in-flight plasma samples were derived from genes with diverse tissue-specifities, including brain, skeletal and heart muscles, minor tissue types (retina, choroid plexus, tongue, skin, neuroendocrine organs like the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid glands). (Some never been analysed before even in mouse spaceflight missions - Fumi update)

\- successfully identified enriched RNA that were not detected using bulk cfRNA-seq (eg. Retina).

\


Discussion

\- NASA twins study consistent:&#x20;

Find oxidative stress and related pathways
